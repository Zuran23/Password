JavaDocs were added to this project to clearly describe the purpose of each class, method, and important variable. These comments help explain how the program works and make the code easier for us and others to understand.

After writing the JavaDoc comments, the documentation was generated into HTML pages and stored in the docs/ folder. GitHub Pages is used to host these files online, so the JavaDocs can be viewed in a browser without needing the project files.

Using JavaDocs improves code readability, helps with debugging, and provides a professional level of documentation for the project.
